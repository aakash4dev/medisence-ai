## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+** (You already have Python 3.14.2 ✅)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- VS Code (recommended)

### Step 1: Install Backend Dependencies
Open terminal in VS Code and run:
```powershell
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- Flask 2.3.3 (Web server)
- flask-cors 4.0.0 (Cross-origin requests)

### Step 2: Start the Backend Server
```powershell
python app.py
```

You should see:
```
🚀 MedicSense AI Backend Starting...
📡 Server running at http://localhost:5000
💊 Medical chatbot ready to assist
```

**Keep this terminal running!**

### Step 3: Open the Frontend
Two options:

**Option A - Direct File Open:**
1. Right-click `index.html`
2. Select "Open with" → Your browser

**Option B - Live Server (Recommended):**
1. Install Live Server extension in VS Code
2. Right-click `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

The website will open at `http://localhost:5000` or similar.

### Step 4: Start Using MedicSense AI! 🎉
1. Click the **blue chat icon** (bottom-right corner)
2. Describe your symptoms
3. Get medical guidance!

## 🩺 How It Works

### Severity Classification System
| Level | Name | Description | Response |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| **1** | Mild | Common cold, headache | Self-care advice, family doctor suggestion |
| **2** | Moderate | Fever, persistent cough | Doctor consultation recommended |
| **3** | Serious | Chronic symptoms, chest pain | Specialist referral, urgent care |
| **4** | Emergency | Snake bite, unconscious | Immediate first-aid, call 911/112 |

### Example Interactions

**Mild Symptoms:**
```
User: "I have a mild headache"
Bot: This appears to be a mild condition.
     💡 Rest and stay hydrated. Monitor symptoms.
     👨‍⚕️ Consider consulting family doctor if persists.
```

**Emergency:**
```
User: "Snake bite!"
Bot: 🚨 EMERGENCY: Snake Bite
     1. Call emergency services IMMEDIATELY
     2. Keep patient calm and still
     3. Position wound below heart level
     [+ First aid steps]
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Symptom Analysis
- Natural language processing
- Pattern matching for symptoms
- Synonym recognition ("fever" = "temperature")

### 2. Emergency Detection
Recognizes critical keywords:
- unconscious, bleeding heavily, snake bite
- cannot breathe, heart attack, stroke
- Provides immediate first-aid instructions

### 3. Family Doctor System
- Save your doctor's information
- Personalized responses for mild symptoms
- Quick reference for consultations

### 4. Safety First
- **Non-medical query filter**: "Tell me a joke" → "I'm trained only for medical problems"
- **Emergency override**: Always directs to emergency services when needed
- **Clear disclaimers**: Not a medical diagnosis tool

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Add More Symptoms
Edit `backend/medical_kb.json`:
```json
"new_symptom": {
  "description": "Symptom description",
  "urgency": "low",
  "common_causes": ["Cause1", "Cause2"],
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
}
```

### Add Doctors/Hospitals
Edit `backend/doctors_db.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "Dr. New Doctor",
  "specialization": "Cardiologist",
  "city": "Mumbai",
  "contact": "+91-555-1234"
}
```

### Modify Severity Rules
Edit `backend/severity_classifier.py`:
- Update `level_indicators` dictionary
- Adjust time-based urgency rules

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Server Won't Start
```powershell
# Check Python
python --version

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade flask flask-cors
```

### Frontend Not Connecting
1. Ensure backend is running: `http://localhost:5000`
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Verify CORS is enabled in `app.py`

### Chatbot Not Responding
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for network errors
3. Verify backend URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/chat`
